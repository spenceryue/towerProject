# towerProject1

AUTHOR: SPENCER YUE


The objective of this program is to organize 10,000 randomly weighed and
colored blocks into the tallest tower possible while observing 2 simple
rules:

(1) Only a lighter block may be stacked on top of another block.
(2) Only same-colored sides of two blocks can meet at an interface.


One solution produced by this program has been recorded in the file
"sample program output (2015/08/29).txt)".

There are four files in the source folder (src) of this project:
(1) Blocks.java
(2) Block.java
(3) Block_VERSION_1_OBSOLETE.java
(4) TimeReporter.java

The first version of the main algorithm (file 3) was able to complete a
tower with the given rules, but used only about 10% of the blocks provided.

The second version (file 1) is able to build a tower using 70% of the
blocks provided and at great speed (3 seconds).

This project represents a challenging computer science problem that I was
able to solve using my experience in Java.
