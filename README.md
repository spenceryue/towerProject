# towerProject1

AUTHOR: SPENCER YUE<br><br>


The objective of this project is to organize 10,000 randomly weighed and<br>
colored blocks into the tallest tower possible while observing 2 simple rules:<br>

(1) Only a lighter block can stacked on top of another block.<br>
(2) Only same-colored sides of two blocks can meet at an interface.<br>

One such tower produced by this program has been recorded in the file<br>
"sample program output (2015/08/29).txt)".<br>

There are four files in the source folder (src) of this project:<br>
(1) Blocks.java<br>
(2) Block.java<br>
(3) Block_VERSION_1_OBSOLETE.java<br>
(4) TimeReporter.java<br>

The first version of the main algorithm (file 3) was able to complete a<br>
tower with the given rules, but used only about 10% of the blocks provided.<br>

The second version (file 1) is able to build a tower using 70% of the<br>
blocks provided and at great speed (3 seconds).<br>

This project represents a challenging computer science problem that I was<br>
able to solve.
